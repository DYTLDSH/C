# Three Kinds of Type Qualifiers
- ## **Const, Volatile, Mutable**
Type qualifiers is used to refine the declaration of a variable, a function and parameters. In C++ there are three kinds of qualifiers. The type qualifiers specify something about how it is accessed or where it is stored. Specifically, type qualifiers const and volatile also named as cv-qualifiers. The type qualifiers are only meaningful for lvalues.
- ## **Const**
The const qualifier defines the type that is a constant whoes value can not be changed. When define a variable that is a constant it must be initialized. Because if we do not initialize it and we can not modify its value which makes the variable useless.
- ## **Volatile**
- ## **Mutable**
