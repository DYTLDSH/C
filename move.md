For an rvalue, it different from lvalue. rvalue is a temporary object which do not have a name. The return value of a function and the value of an expression are rvalues. We can understand lvalue and rvalue as lvalue is a container but rvalue is the value in the container. We can get the specific address of lvalue, but we can not get the address of a rvalue. rvalue always has a short lifetime.
